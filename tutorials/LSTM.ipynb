    "- **Identifying Data Bias** - Bias is a component of the human thought process, and data collected from humans therefore inherently reflects that bias. Some ways in which this bias tends to occur in Machine Learning datasets are:\n",
    "    - *Bias in historical data*: Historical data are often skewed towards, or against, particular groups.\n",
    "        Data can also be severely imbalanced with limited information on protected groups.\n",
    "    - *Bias in data collection mechanisms*: Lack of representativeness introduces inherent biases in the data collection process.  \n",
    "    - *Bias towards observable outcomes*: In some scenarios, we have the information about True Outcomes only for a certain section of the population. In the absence of information on all outcomes, one cannot even measure fairness\n",
    "- **Preserving human anonymity for sensitive data**: [Trevisan and Reilly](https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/91157/1/Ethical%20dilemmas.pdf) identified a list of sensitive topics that need to be handled with extra care. We present the same below along with a few additions:\n",
    "    - personal daily routines (including location data);\n",
    "    - individual details about impairment and/or medical records;\n",
    "    - emotional accounts of pain and chronic illness;\n",

    "    - suicidal thoughts;\n",
    "    - criticism/praise of a power structure especially if it compromises their safety;\n",
    "    - personally-identifying information (even if anonymized in some way) including things like fingerprints or voice.\n",

    "## 2. Preprocess the datasets\n",
    ">Preprocessing data is an extremely crucial step before building any Deep learning model, however in an attempt to keep the tutorial focused on building the model, we will not dive deep into the code for preprocessing. Given below is a brief overview of all the steps we undertake to clean our data and convert it to its numeric representation. The [code](https://github.com/Dbhasin1/ethics-tutorial/blob/lstm-update/tutorials/text_preprocessing.py) is public and we encourage you to look it up for a better understanding of this section and can make ethical preprocessing choices in your future work.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Text Denoising** : Before converting your text into vectors, it is important to clean it and remove all unhelpful parts a.k.a the noise from your data by converting all characters to lowercase, removing html tags, brackets and stop words (words that don't add much meaning to a sentence). Without this step the dataset is often a cluster of words that the computer doesn't understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Converting words to vectors** : A word embedding is a learned representation for text where words that have the same meaning have a similar representation. Individual words are represented as real-valued vectors in a predefined vector space. GloVe is an unsupervised algorithm developed by Stanford for generating word embeddings by generating global word-word co-occurence matrix from a corpus. You can download the zipped files containing the embeddings from https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/. Here you can choose any of the four options for different sizes or training datasets\n",
    " >The GloVe word embeddings include sets that were trained on billions of tokens, some up to 840 billion tokens. These algorithms exhibit stereotypical biases, such as gender bias which can be traced back to the original training data. For example certain occupations seem to be more biased towards a particular gender, reinforcing problematic stereotypes. The nearest solution to this problem are some de-biasing algorithms as the one presented in https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1184/reports/6835575.pdf which one can use on embeddings of their choice to mitigate bias, if present."

    "### 3. Build the Deep Learning Model¶\n",
    " ---\n",
    " It’s time to start implementing our LSTM! You will have to first familiarize yourself with some high-level concepts of the basic building blocks of a deep learning model. You can refer to the [Deep learning on MNIST from scratch tutorial](https://numpy.org/numpy-tutorials/content/tutorial-deep-learning-on-mnist.html) for the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will then learn how a Recurrent Neural Network differs from a plain Neural Network and what makes it so suitable for processing sequential data. Afterwards, you will construct the building blocks of a simple deep learning model in Python and NumPy and train it to learn to classify the sentiment of a piece of text as positive or negative with a certain level of accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to a Long Short Term Memory Network\n",
    "\n",
    "In an artificial neural network (ANN), the information only moves in one direction — from the input layer, through the hidden layers, to the output layer. The information moves straight through the network and never takes the previous nodes into account at a later stage. Because it only considers the current input, the features learned are not shared across different positions of the sequence. Moreover, it cannot process sequences with varying lengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike an ANN, the RNN was designed to work with sequence prediction problems.RNNs introduce state variables to store past information, together with the current inputs, to determine the current outputs. Since an RNN shares the learned features with all the data points in a sequence regardless of its length, it is capable of processing sequences with varying lengths.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with an RNN however, is that it cannot retain long-term memory because the influence of a given input on the hidden layer, and therefore on the network output, either decays or blows up exponentially as it cycles around the network’s recurrent connections. This shortcoming is referred to as the vanishing gradient problem. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is an RNN architecture specifically designed to address the [vanishing gradient problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanishing_gradient_problem)."

To classify this information into various classes (2 in our case, positive and negative) we can use a Fully Connected layer which firstly maps this information to a predefined output size (1 in our case) and an activation layer like sigmoid on top of it finally converts the output to a value between 0 and 1. We'll consider values greater than 0.5 to be indicative of a positive sentiment."

Specifically, the algorithm calculates an exponential moving average of the gradient and the squared gradient, and the parameters `beta1` and `beta2` control the decay rates of these moving averages. Adam has shown increased convergence and robustness over other gradient descent algorithms and is often recommended as the default optimizer for training."

    "In the plot above, you're shown what percentages of each speech are expected to carry a positive and negative  sentiment. Since this implementation prioritised simplicity and clarity over performance, we cannot expect these results to be much accurate. Moreover, while making the sentiment predictions for one paragraph we did not use the neighbouring paragraphs for context which would have led to more accurate predictions. We encourage the reader to play around with the model and make some tweaks suggested in `Next Steps` and observe how the model performance changes."

    "It's crucial to understand that accurately identifying a text's sentiment is not easy primarily because of the complex ways in which humans express sentiment, using irony, sarcasm, humor, or, in social media, abbreviation. Moreover neatly placing text into two categories: 'positive' and 'negative' can be problematic because it is being done without any context. Words or abbreviations can convey very different sentiments depending on age and location, none of which we took into account while building our model.\n",

Certain biases such as the [Inductive Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_bias#:~:text=The%20inductive%20bias%20(also%20known,that%20it%20has%20not%20encountered.&text=The%20kind%20of%20necessary%20assumptions,in%20the%20phrase%20inductive%20bias) are absolutely essential to help a Machine Learning model generalise better, for example the LSTM we built earlier is biased towards preserving contextual information over long sequences which makes it so suitable for processing sequential data. The problem arises when [societal biases](https://hbr.org/2019/10/what-do-we-do-about-the-biases-in-ai) creep into algorithmic predictions. Optimizing Machine algorithms via methods like [hyperparameter tuning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_optimization) can then further amplify these biases by learning every bit of information in the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also cases where bias is only in the output and not the inputs (data, algorithm). For example, in sentiment analysis [accuracy tends to be higher on female-authored texts than on male-authored ones]( https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics9020374). End users of sentiment analysis should be aware that its small gender biases can affect the conclusions drawn from it and apply correction factors when necessary. Hence, it is important that demands for algorithmic accountability should include the ability to test the outputs of a system, including the ability to drill down into different user groups by gender, ethnicity and other characteristics, to identify, and hopefully suggest corrections for, system output biases."

    "You have learned how to build and train a simple Long Short Term Memory network from scratch using just NumPy to perform sentiment analysis.\n",

    "To further enhance and optimize your neural network model, you can consider one of a mixture of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Increase the training sample size by increasing the `split_percentile`.\n",
    "- Alter the architecture by introducing multiple LSTM layers to make the network deeper.\n",
    "- Use a higher epoch size to train longer and add more regularization techniques, such as early stopping, to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "- Introduce a validation set for an unbiased valuation of the model fit.\n",
    "- Apply batch normalization for faster and more stable training.\n",
    "- Tune other parameters, such as the learning rate and hidden layer size.\n",
    "- Initialise weights using [Xavier Initialisation](https://d2l.ai/chapter_multilayer-perceptrons/numerical-stability-and-init.html) to prevent vanishing/exploding gradients instead of initialising them randomly.\n",
    "- Replace LSTM with a [Bidirectional LSTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirectional_recurrent_neural_networks) to use both left and right context for predicting sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nowadays, LSTMs have been replaced by the [Transformer](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/)( which uses [Attention](https://jalammar.github.io/visualizing-neural-machine-translation-mechanics-of-seq2seq-models-with-attention/) to tackle all the problems that plague an LSTM such as as lack of [transfer learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning), lack of [parallel training](https://web.stanford.edu/~rezab/classes/cme323/S16/projects_reports/hedge_usmani.pdf) and a long gradient chain for lengthy sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "Building a neural network from scratch with NumPy is a great way to learn more about NumPy and about deep learning. However, for real-world applications you should use specialized frameworks — such as PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow or MXNet — that provide NumPy-like APIs, have built-in automatic differentiation and GPU support, and are designed for high-performance numerical computing and machine learning.\n",
